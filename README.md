# Anonymous Function Community Events

Use this repository to [propose or request talks](https://github.com/anonymous-function/events/issues) for the meetup of the Anonymous Function Community.

Propose or request an event; no need to worry about making mistakes or giving/requesting an event that's already been done!

See below for some ideas.

## Proposing An Event

If you'd like to give a leadership-related event, we're here to help. If you don't have a venue for your event, we can get you in touch with leaders of local meetup venues. If you don't have a topic, we can find something for you to talk about. If you do have a topic, we can try to find an existing pre-made talk that fits it. And if you already have a talk all planned, we can help proofread your slides. File an issue here with the details and label it with the `proposal` tag, and we'll work with you from there.

## Requesting An Event

Would you like to see an event on a particular topic? Something you'd like to understand better, or an interesting area?

Raise an issue with the details and label it with `request`, and we'll see if we can organise someone to give that talk.

## What Can An Event Be About?

First up, there's no need to be an expert of any kind, so don't feel like you have to be in order to talk.

Secondly, you can talk about anything leadership related! Aside from looking at what other people have requested, here are some ideas:

- 1-on-1s
- Communication Skills
- Culture
- Feedback (Giving & Receiving)
- Leadership Styles
- Meetings
- Negotiation Style
- Personal Brand
- Team Building
- Teamwork
